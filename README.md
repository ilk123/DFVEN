>**Abstract:** *In percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy for lumbar disc herniation and lumbar spinal stenosis, intraoperative endoscopic image quality is often impaired due to the confined surgical area and the aquatic operating environment. Therefore, we investigated the identification of the image degradation inherent to the environment of spinal endoscopic surgery, and proposed a degradation representation encoder guiding the enhancement direction. We further constructed a deep learning model for real-time endoscopic video enhancement named DFVEN, which leverages the information from our degradation model and the continuity of video frames. Our approach comprehensively integrates the degradation characteristics and video sequence information to enhance image quality effectively. We implemented the proposed deep learning model in a real surgical imaging system and demonstrated its exceptional performance in enhancing high-frame-rate endoscopic images, significantly improving visual quality and aiding in more accurate and safer surgical procedures.*
